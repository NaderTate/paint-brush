# Paint brush

## How to run

### Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/nadertate/paint-brush`

### Install the dependencies:

`npm i`

### Run the project:

`npm run dev`

## Issues I'm aware of:

1. Background color doesn't appear when you save the image.
2. Changing the brush size will change the size of all previously drawn lines.
